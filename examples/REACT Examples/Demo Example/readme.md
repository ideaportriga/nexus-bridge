# Quick Start Guide: Nexus19 + React example

This guide will help to setup Nexus19 with the demo of a Form Applet that is built using Nexus19 and React framework.
<br>The applet supports:
- navigation through records
- displaying, editing or deleting records (supporting keyboard shortcuts)
- query and refine query (supporting keyboard shortcuts)
- picklists that are read from Siebel configuration
- field properties that are read from Siebel configuration (required, field length)

Requirements: this example requires access to icons and fonts stored on https://fonts.googleapis.com/

This is not an example of implementation that can be used on production. It is intentionally kept straightforward.
The demo example was tested on Seibel 16.19 and 18.08 ENU.
